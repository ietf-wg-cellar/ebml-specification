# EBML specifications

## EBML principle

EBML is short for Extensible Binary Meta Language. EBML specifies a
binary and octet (byte) aligned format inspired by the principle of XML.
EBML itself is a generalized description of the technique of binary
markup. Like XML, it is completely agnostic to any data that it might
contain. Therein, the Matroska project is a specific implementation
using the rules of EBML: It seeks to define a subset of the EBML
language in the context of audio and video data (though it obviously
isn't limited to this purpose). The format is made of 2 parts: the
semantic and the syntax. The semantic specifies a number of IDs and
their basic type and is not included in the data file/stream.

Just like XML, the specific "tags" (IDs in EBML parlance) used in an
EBML implementation are arbitrary. However, the semantic of EBML
outlines general data types and ID's.

The known basic types are:

Data Type        | Definition
-----------------|----------------------------------------------------
Signed Integer   | Big-endian, any size from 1 to 8 octets
Unsigned Integer | Big-endian, any size from 1 to 8 octets
Float            | Big-endian, defined for 4 and 8 octets (32, 64 bits)
String           | Printable ASCII (0x20 to 0x7E), zero-padded when
                 | needed
UTF-8            | [Unicode string](http://www.unicode.org/), zero
                 | padded when needed ([RFC 2279](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2279.html))
Date             | signed 8 octets integer in nanoseconds with 0
                 | indicating the precise beginning of the
                 | millennium (at 2001-01-01T00:00:00.000000000 UTC)
Master-element   | contains other EBML sub-elements of the next lower
                 | level
Binary           | not interpreted by the parser

As well as defining standard data types, EBML uses a system of Elements
to make up an EBML "document". Elements incorporate an Element ID, a
descriptor for the size of the element, and the binary data itself.
Futher, Elements can be nested or contain Elements of a lower "level".

### Element ID

The EBML Element ID is encoded as a variable size integer with, by
default, widths up to 4. Another maximum width value can be set by
assigning that value to EBMLMaxIDLength in the EBML header. Element IDs
are always encoded in their shortest form, e.g. 1 is always encoded as
0x81 and never as 0x4001. This limits the number of IDs in every class
with the number of IDs in the previous classes. Furthermore, values
with all data bits set to 1 and all data bits set to 0 are reserved,
hence the effective number of IDs are as follows for different widths.
Note that the shortest encoding form for 127 is 0x407f since 0x7f is
reserved.

Width | Class ID | Number of Element IDs
------|----------|------------------------
1     | Class A  | 2^7-2     = 126
2     | Class B  | 2^14-2^7  = 16,256
3     | Class C  | 2^21-2^14 = 2,080,768
4     | Class D  | 2^28-2^21 = 266,338,304

Element IDs are outlined as follows, beginning with the ID itself,
followed by the Data Size, and then the non-interpreted Binary itself:

-   Element ID coded with an UTF-8 like system :

        bits, big-endian
        1xxx xxxx                                  - Class A IDs (2^7 -1 possible values) (base 0x8X)
        01xx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                       - Class B IDs (2^14-1 possible values) (base 0x4X 0xXX)
        001x xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx            - Class C IDs (2^21-1 possible values) (base 0x2X 0xXX 0xXX)
        0001 xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx - Class D IDs (2^28-1 possible values) (base 0x1X 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX)

    Some Notes:

    -   The leading bits of the Class IDs are used to identify the
        length of the ID. The number of leading 0's + 1 is the length of
        the ID in octets. We will refer to the leading bits as the
        Length Descriptor.
    -   Any ID where all x's are composed entirely of 1's is a Reserved
        ID, thus the -1 in the definitions above.
    -   The Reserved IDs (all x set to 1) are the only IDs that may
        change the Length Descriptor.

-   Data size, in octets, is also coded with an UTF-8 like system :

        bits, big-endian
        1xxx xxxx                                                                              - value 0 to  2^7-2
        01xx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                                                   - value 0 to 2^14-2
        001x xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                                        - value 0 to 2^21-2
        0001 xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                             - value 0 to 2^28-2
        0000 1xxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                  - value 0 to 2^35-2
        0000 01xx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                       - value 0 to 2^42-2
        0000 001x  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx            - value 0 to 2^49-2
        0000 0001  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx - value 0 to 2^56-2

    Since modern computers do not easily deal with data coded in sizes
    greater than 64 bits, any larger Element Sizes are left undefined at
    the moment. Currently, the Element Size coding allows for an Element
    to grow to 72000 To, i.e. 7x10\^16 octets or 72000 terabytes, which
    will be sufficient for the time being.

    There is only one reserved word for Element Size encoding, which is
    an Element Size encoded to all 1's. Such a coding indicates that the
    size of the Element is unknown, which is a special case that we
    believe will be useful for live streaming purposes. However, avoid
    using this reserved word unnecessarily, because it makes parsing
    slower and more difficult to implement.

-   Data
    -   Integers are stored in their standard big-endian form (no
        UTF-like encoding), only the size may differ from their usual
        form (24 or 40 bits for example).
    -   The Signed Integer is just the big-endian representation trimmed
        from some 0x00 and 0xFF where they are not meaningful (sign).
        For example -2 can be coded as 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFE or 0xFFFE or
        0xFE and 5 can be coded 0x000000000005 or 0x0005 or 0x05.
