# Introduction

`EBML`, short for Extensible Binary Meta Language, specifies a binary and octet (byte) aligned format inspired by the principle of XML (a framework for structuring data).

The goal of this document is to define a generic, binary, space-efficient format that can be used to define more complex formats (such as containers for multimedia content) using an `EBML Schema`. The definition of the `EBML` format recognizes the idea behind HTML and XML as a good one: separate structure and semantics allowing the same structural layer to be used with multiple, possibly widely differing semantic layers. Except for the `EBML Header` and a few `Global Elements` this specification does not define particular `EBML` format semantics; however this specification is intended to define how other `EBML`-based formats can be defined.

`EBML` uses a simple approach of building `Elements` upon three pieces of data (tag, length, and value) as this approach is well known, easy to parse, and allows selective data parsing. The `EBML` structure additionally allows for hierarchical arrangement to support complex structural formats in an efficient manner.

# Notation and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

This document defines specific terms in order to define the format and application of `EBML`. Specific terms are defined below:

`EBML`: Extensible Binary Meta Language

`EBML Document Type`: An `EBML Document Type` is a name provided by an `EBML Schema` for a particular implementation of `EBML` for a data format (examples: matroska and webm).

`EBML Schema`: A standardized definition for the structure of an `EBML Document Type`.

`EBML Document`: An `EBML Document` is a datastream comprised of only two components, an `EBML Header` and an `EBML Body`.

`EBML Reader`: An `EBML Reader` is a data parser that interprets the semantics of an `EBML Document` and creates a way for programs to use `EBML`.

`EBML Stream`: An `EBML Stream` is a file that consists of one or more `EBML Documents` that are concatenated together.

`EBML Header`: The `EBML Header` is a declaration that provides processing instructions and identification of the `EBML Body`. The `EBML Header` may be considered as analogous to an XML Declaration [@!W3C.REC-xml-20081126] (see section 2.8 on Prolog and Document Type Declaration).

`EBML Body`: All data of an `EBML Document` following the `EBML Header` may be considered the `EBML Body`.

`Variable Size Integer`: A compact variable-length binary value which defines its own length.

`VINT`: Also known as `Variable Size Integer`.

`EBML Element`: A foundation block of data that contains three parts: an `Element ID`, an `Element Data Size`, and `Element Data`.

`Element ID`: The `Element ID` is a binary value, encoded as a `Variable Size Integer`, used to uniquely identify a defined `EBML Element` within a specific `EBML Schema`.

`EBML Class`: A representation of the octet length of an `Element ID`.

`Element Data Size`: An expression, encoded as a `Variable Size Integer`, of the length in octets of `Element Data`.

`VINTMAX`: The maximum possible value that can be stored as `Element Data Size`.

`Unknown-Sized Element`: An `Element` with an unknown `Element Data Size`.

`Element Data`: The value(s) of the `EBML Element` which is identified by its `Element ID` and `Element Data Size`. The form of the `Element Data` is defined by this document and the corresponding `EBML Schema` of the Element's `EBML Document Type`.

`Root Level`: The starting level in the hierarchy of an `EBML Document`.

`Root Element`: A mandatory, non-repeating `EBML Element` which occurs at the top level of the path hierarchy within an `EBML Body` and contains all other `EBML Elements` of the `EBML Body`, excepting optional `Void Elements`.

`Top-Level Element`: An `EBML Element` defined to only occur as a `Child Element` of the `Root Element`.

`Master Element`: The `Master Element` contains zero, one, or many other `EBML Elements`.

`Child Element`: A `Child Element` is a relative term to describe the `EBML Elements` immediately contained within a `Master Element`.

`Parent Element`: A relative term to describe the `Master Element` which contains a specified element. For any specified `EBML Element` that is not at `Root Level`, the `Parent Element` refers to the `Master Element` in which that `EBML Element` is contained.

`Descendant Element`: A `Descendant Element` is a relative term to describe any `EBML Elements` contained within a `Master Element`, including any of the `Child Elements` of its `Child Elements`, and so on.

`Void Element`: A `Void Element` is an `Element` used to overwrite damaged data or reserve space within a `Master Element` for later use.

`Element Name`: The official human-readable name of the `EBML Element`.

`Element Path`: The hierarchy of `Parent Element` where the `EBML Element` is expected to be found in the `EBML Body`.

`Empty Element`: An `Empty Element` is an `EBML Element` that has an `Element Data Size` with all `VINT_DATA` bits set to zero which indicates that the `Element Data` of the Element is zero octets in length.

# Security Considerations

`EBML` itself does not offer any kind of security and does not provide confidentiality. `EBML` does not provide any kind of authorization. `EBML` only offers marginally useful and effective data integrity options, such as CRC elements.

Even if the semantic layer offers any kind of encryption, `EBML` itself could leak information at both the semantic layer (as declared via the `DocType Element`) and within the `EBML` structure (the presence of `EBML Elements` can be derived even with an unknown semantic layer using a heuristic approach; not without errors, of course, but with a certain degree of confidence).

Attacks on an `EBML Reader` could include:

- Invalid `Element IDs` that are longer than the limit stated in the `EBMLMaxIDLength Element` of the `EBML Header`.
- Invalid `Element IDs` that are not encoded in the shortest-possible way.
- Invalid `Element IDs` comprised of reserved values.
- Invalid `Element Data Size` values that are longer than the limit stated in the `EBMLMaxSizeLength Element` of the `EBML Header`.
- Invalid `Element Data Size` values (e.g. extending the length of the `EBML Element` beyond the scope of the `Parent Element`; possibly triggering access-out-of-bounds issues).
- Very high lengths in order to force out-of-memory situations resulting in a denial of service, access-out-of-bounds issues etc.
- Missing `EBML Elements` that are mandatory and have no declared default value.
- Usage of `0x00` octets in `EBML Elements` with a string type.
- Usage of invalid UTF-8 encoding in `EBML Elements` of UTF-8 type (e.g. in order to trigger access-out-of-bounds or buffer overflow issues).
- Usage of invalid data in `EBML Elements` with a date type.

Side channel attacks could exploit:

- The semantic equivalence of the same string stored in a `String Element` or `UTF-8 Element` with and without zero-bit padding.
- The semantic equivalence of `VINT_DATA` within `Element Data Size` with to different lengths due to left-padding zero bits.
- Data contained within a `Master Element` which is not itself part of an `EBML Element`.
- Extraneous copies of `Identically Recurring Element`.
- Copies of `Identically Recurring Element` within a `Parent Element` that contain invalid `CRC-32 Elements`.
- Use of `Void Elements`.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Structure

`EBML` uses a system of Elements to compose an `EBML Document`. `EBML Elements` incorporate three parts: an `Element ID`, an `Element Data Size`, and `Element Data`. The `Element Data`, which is described by the `Element ID`, includes either binary data, one or many other `EBML Elements`, or both.

# Variable Size Integer

The `Element ID` and `Element Data Size` are both encoded as a `Variable Size Integer`, developed according to a UTF-8 like system. The `Variable Size Integer` is composed of a `VINT_WIDTH`, `VINT_MARKER`, and `VINT_DATA`, in that order. `Variable Size Integers` SHALL left-pad the `VINT_DATA` value with zero bits so that the whole `Variable Size Integer` is octet-aligned. `Variable Size Integers` SHALL be referred to as `VINT` for shorthand.

## VINT_WIDTH

Each `Variable Size Integer` begins with a `VINT_WIDTH` which consists of zero or many zero-value bits. The count of consecutive zero-values of the `VINT_WIDTH` plus one equals the length in octets of the `Variable Size Integer`. For example, a `Variable Size Integer` that starts with a `VINT_WIDTH` which contains zero consecutive zero-value bits is one octet in length and a `Variable Size Integer` that starts with one consecutive zero-value bit is two octets in length. The `VINT_WIDTH` MUST only contain zero-value bits or be empty.

Within the `EBML Header` the `VINT_WIDTH` MUST NOT exceed three bits in length (meaning that the `Variable Size Integer` MUST NOT exceed four octets in length). Within the `EBML Body`, when `VINTs` are used to express an `Element ID`, the maximum length allowed for the `VINT_WIDTH` is one less than the value set in the `EBMLMaxIDLength Element`. Within the `EBML Body`, when `VINTs` are used to express an `Element Data Size`, the maximum length allowed for the `VINT_WIDTH` is one less than the value set in the `EBMLMaxSizeLength Element`.

## VINT_MARKER

The `VINT_MARKER` serves as a separator between the `VINT_WIDTH` and `VINT_DATA`. Each `Variable Size Integer` MUST contain exactly one `VINT_MARKER`. The `VINT_MARKER` MUST be one bit in length and contain a bit with a value of one. The first bit with a value of one within the `Variable Size Integer` is the `VINT_MARKER`.

## VINT_DATA

The `VINT_DATA` portion of the `Variable Size Integer` includes all data that follows (but not including) the `VINT_MARKER` until end of the `Variable Size Integer` whose length is derived from the `VINT_WIDTH`. The bits required for the `VINT_WIDTH` and the `VINT_MARKER` combined use one out of eight bits of the total length of the `Variable Size Integer`. Thus a `Variable Size Integer` of 1 octet length supplies 7 bits for `VINT_DATA`, a 2 octet length supplies 14 bits for `VINT_DATA`, and a 3 octet length supplies 21 bits for `VINT_DATA`. If the number of bits required for `VINT_DATA` are less than the bit size of `VINT_DATA`, then `VINT_DATA` SHOULD be zero-padded to the left to a size that fits. The `VINT_DATA` value MUST be expressed as a big-endian unsigned integer.

## VINT Examples

This table shows examples of `Variable Size Integers` with lengths from 1 to 5 octets. The Size column refers to the size of the `VINT_DATA` in bits. The Representation column depicts a binary expression of `Variable Size Integers` where `VINT_WIDTH` is depicted by '0', the `VINT_MARKER` as '1', and the `VINT_DATA` as 'x'.

Octet Length | Size | Representation
-------------|------|:-------------------------------------------------
1            | 2^7  | 1xxx xxxx
2            | 2^14 | 01xx xxxx xxxx xxxx
3            | 2^21 | 001x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
4            | 2^28 | 0001 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
5            | 2^35 | 0000 1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

Data encoded as a `Variable Size Integer` MAY be rendered at octet lengths larger than needed to store the data. In this table a binary value of `0b10` is shown encoded as different `Variable Size Integers` with lengths from one octet to four octet. All four encoded examples have identical semantic meaning though the `VINT_WIDTH` and the padding of the `VINT_DATA` vary.

Binary Value | Octet Length | As Represented in Variable Size Integer
-------------|--------------|:---------------------------------------
10           | 1            | 1000 0010
10           | 2            | 0100 0000 0000 0010
10           | 3            | 0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010
10           | 4            | 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010

# Element ID

The `Element ID` MUST be encoded as a `Variable Size Integer`. By default, `Element IDs` are encoded in lengths from one octet to four octets, although `Element IDs` of greater lengths are used if the octet length of the longest `Element ID` of the `EBML Document` is declared in the `EBMLMaxIDLength Element` of the `EBML Header` (see [the section on the `EBMLMaxIDLength Element`](#ebmlmaxidlength-element)). The `VINT_DATA` component of the `Element ID` MUST NOT be either defined or written as either all zero values or all one values. Any `Element ID` with the `VINT_DATA` component set as all zero values or all one values MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be considered an error in the `EBML Document`. The `VINT_DATA` component of the `Element ID` MUST be encoded at the shortest valid length. For example, an `Element ID` with binary encoding of `1011 1111` is valid, whereas an `Element ID` with binary encoding of `0100 0000 0011 1111` stores a semantically equal `VINT_DATA` but is invalid because a shorter `VINT` encoding is possible. Additionally, an `Element ID` with binary encoding of `1111 1111` is invalid since the `VINT_DATA` section is set to all one values, whereas an `Element ID` with binary encoding of `0100 0000 0111 1111` stores a semantically equal `VINT_DATA` and is the shortest possible `VINT` encoding.

The following table details these specific examples further:

VINT_WIDTH  | VINT_MARKER  | VINT_DATA      | Element ID Status
-----------:|-------------:|---------------:|:-----------------
|           | 1            |        0000000 | Invalid: `VINT_DATA` MUST NOT be set to all 0
0           | 1            | 00000000000000 | Invalid: `VINT_DATA` MUST NOT be set to all 0
|           | 1            |        0000001 | Valid
0           | 1            | 00000000000001 | Invalid: A shorter `VINT_DATA` encoding is available.
|           | 1            |        0111111 | Valid
0           | 1            | 00000000111111 | Invalid: A shorter `VINT_DATA` encoding is available.
|           | 1            |        1111111 | Invalid: `VINT_DATA` MUST NOT be set to all 1
0           | 1            | 00000001111111 | Valid

The octet length of an `Element ID` determines its `EBML Class`.

EBML Class | Octet Length | Number of Possible Element IDs
:---------:|:------------:|:------------------------------
Class A    | 1            | 2^7  - 2        =         126
Class B    | 2            | 2^14 - 2^7  - 1 =      16,255
Class C    | 3            | 2^21 - 2^14 - 1 =   2,080,767
Class D    | 4            | 2^28 - 2^21 - 1 = 266,338,303

# Element Data Size

The `Element Data Size` expresses the length in octets of `Element Data`. The `Element Data Size` itself MUST be encoded as a `Variable Size Integer`. By default, `Element Data Sizes` can be encoded in lengths from one octet to eight octets, although `Element Data Sizes` of greater lengths MAY be used if the octet length of the longest `Element Data Size` of the `EBML Document` is declared in the `EBMLMaxSizeLength Element` of the `EBML Header` (see [the section on the `EBMLMaxSizeLength Element`](#ebmlmaxsizelength-element)). Unlike the `VINT_DATA` of the `Element ID`, the `VINT_DATA` component of the `Element Data Size` is not mandated to be encoded at the shortest valid length. For example, an `Element Data Size` with binary encoding of `1011 1111` or a binary encoding of `0100 0000 0011 1111` are both valid `Element Data Sizes` and both store a semantically equal value (both `0b00000000111111` and `0b0111111`, the `VINT_DATA` sections of the examples, represent the integer 63).

Although an `Element ID` with all `VINT_DATA` bits set to zero is invalid, an `Element Data Size` with all `VINT_DATA` bits set to zero is allowed for `EBML Element Types` which do not mandate a non-zero length (see [the section on `EBML Element Types`](#ebml-element-types)). An `Element Data Size` with all `VINT_DATA` bits set to zero indicates that the `Element Data` is zero octets in length. Such an `EBML Element` is referred to as an `Empty Element`. If an `Empty Element` has a `default` value declared then the `EBML Reader` MUST interpret the value of the `Empty Element` as the `default` value. If an `Empty Element` has no `default` value declared then the `EBML Reader` MUST interpret the value of the `Empty Element` as defined as part of the definition of the corresponding `EBML Element Type` associated with the `Element ID`.

An `Element Data Size` with all `VINT_DATA` bits set to one is reserved as an indicator that the size of the `EBML Element` is unknown. The only reserved value for the `VINT_DATA` of `Element Data Size` is all bits set to one. An `EBML Element` with an unknown `Element Data Size` is referred to as an `Unknown-Sized Element`. Only `Master Elements` SHALL be `Unknown-Sized Elements`. `Master Elements` MUST NOT use an unknown size unless the `unknownsizeallowed` attribute of their `EBML Schema` is set to true (see [the section on the `unknownsizeallowed` attribute](#unknownsizeallowed)). The use of `Unknown-Sized Elements` allows for an `EBML Element` to be written and read before the size of the `EBML Element` is known. `Unknown-Sized Element` MUST NOT be used or defined unnecessarily; however if the `Element Data Size` is not known before the `Element Data` is written, such as in some cases of data streaming, then `Unknown-Sized Elements` MAY be used. The end of an `Unknown-Sized Element` is determined by whichever comes first: the end of the file or the beginning of the next `EBML Element`, defined by this document or the corresponding `EBML Schema`, that is not independently valid as `Descendant Element` of the `Unknown-Sized Element`.

For `Element Data Sizes` encoded at octet lengths from one to eight, this table depicts the range of possible values that can be encoded as an `Element Data Size`. An `Element Data Size` with an octet length of 8 is able to express a size of 2^56-2 or 72,057,594,037,927,934 octets (or about 72 petabytes). The maximum possible value that can be stored as `Element Data Size` is referred to as `VINTMAX`.

Octet Length | Possible Value Range
-------------|---------------------
1            | 0 to  2^7-2
2            | 0 to 2^14-2
3            | 0 to 2^21-2
4            | 0 to 2^28-2
5            | 0 to 2^35-2
6            | 0 to 2^42-2
7            | 0 to 2^49-2
8            | 0 to 2^56-2

If the length of `Element Data` equals `2^(n*7)-1` then the octet length of the `Element Data Size` MUST be at least `n+1`. This rule prevents an `Element Data Size` from being expressed as a reserved value. For example, an `EBML Element` with an octet length of 127 MUST NOT be encoded in an `Element Data Size` encoding with a one octet length. The following table clarifies this rule by showing a valid and invalid expression of an `Element Data Size` with a `VINT_DATA` of 127 (which is equal to 2^(1*7)-1).

VINT_WIDTH  | VINT_MARKER  | VINT_DATA      | Element Data Size Status
-----------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------------------------
|           | 1            |        1111111 | Reserved (meaning Unknown)
0           | 1            | 00000001111111 | Valid (meaning 127 octets)

# EBML Element Types

`EBML Elements` are defined by an `EBML Schema` which MUST declare one of the following `EBML Element Types` for each `EBML Element`. An `EBML Element Type` defines a concept of storing data within an `EBML Element` that describes such characteristics as length, endianness, and definition.

`EBML Elements` which are defined as a `Signed Integer Element`, `Unsigned Integer Element`, `Float Element`, or `Date Element` use big endian storage.

## Signed Integer Element

A `Signed Integer Element` MUST declare a length from zero to eight octets. If the `EBML Element` is not defined to have a `default` value, then a `Signed Integer Element` with a zero-octet length represents an integer value of zero.

A `Signed Integer Element` stores an integer (meaning that it can be written without a fractional component) which could be negative, positive, or zero. Signed Integers MUST be stored with two's complement notation with the leftmost bit being the sign bit. Because `EBML` limits Signed Integers to 8 octets in length a `Signed Integer Element` stores a number from −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

## Unsigned Integer Element

An `Unsigned Integer Element` MUST declare a length from zero to eight octets. If the `EBML Element` is not defined to have a `default` value, then an `Unsigned Integer Element` with a zero-octet length represents an integer value of zero.

An `Unsigned Integer Element` stores an integer (meaning that it can be written without a fractional component) which could be positive or zero. Because `EBML` limits Unsigned Integers to 8 octets in length an `Unsigned Integer Element` stores a number from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

## Float Element

A `Float Element` MUST declare a length of either zero octets (0 bit), four octets (32 bit) or eight octets (64 bit). If the `EBML Element` is not defined to have a `default` value, then a `Float Element` with a zero-octet length represents a numerical value of zero.

A `Float Element` stores a floating-point number as defined in [@!IEEE.754.1985].

## String Element

A `String Element` MUST declare a length in octets from zero to `VINTMAX`. If the `EBML Element` is not defined to have a `default` value, then a `String Element` with a zero-octet length represents an empty string.

A `String Element` MUST either be empty (zero-length) or contain printable ASCII characters [@!RFC0020] in the range of `0x20` to `0x7E`, with an exception made for termination (see [the section on the `Terminating Elements`](#terminating-elements)).

## UTF-8 Element

A `UTF-8 Element` MUST declare a length in octets from zero to `VINTMAX`. If the `EBML Element` is not defined to have a `default` value, then a `UTF-8 Element` with a zero-octet length represents an empty string.

A `UTF-8 Element` contains only a valid Unicode string as defined in [@!RFC3629], with an exception made for termination (see [the section on the `Terminating Elements`](#terminating-elements)).

## Date Element

A `Date Element` MUST declare a length of either zero octets or eight octets. If the `EBML Element` is not defined to have a `default` value, then a `Date Element` with a zero-octet length represents a timestamp of 2001-01-01T00:00:00.000000000 UTC [@!RFC3339].

The `Date Element` stores an integer in the same format as the `Signed Integer Element` that expresses a point in time referenced in nanoseconds from the precise beginning of the third millennium of the Gregorian Calendar in Coordinated Universal Time (also known as 2001-01-01T00:00:00.000000000 UTC). This provides a possible expression of time from 1708-09-11T00:12:44.854775808 UTC to 2293-04-11T11:47:16.854775807 UTC.

## Master Element

A `Master Element` MUST declare a length in octets from zero to `VINTMAX`. The `Master Element` MAY also use an unknown length. See [the section on `Element Data Size`](#element-data-size) for rules that apply to elements of unknown length.

The `Master Element` contains zero, one, or many other elements. `EBML Elements` contained within a `Master Element` MUST have the `EBMLParentPath` of their `Element Path` equals to the `EBMLReferencePath` of the `Master Element` `Element Path` (see [the section on the `EBML Path`](#path)). `Element Data` stored within `Master Elements` SHOULD only consist of `EBML Elements` and SHOULD NOT contain any data that is not part of an `EBML Element`. When `EBML` is used in transmission or streaming, data that is not part of an `EBML Element` is permitted to be present within a `Master Element` if `unknownsizeallowed` is enabled within the definition for that `Master Element`. In this case, the `EBML Reader` should skip data until a valid `Element ID` of the same `EBMLParentPath` or the next upper level `Element Path` of the `Master Element` is found. What `Element IDs` are considered valid within a `Master Element` is identified by the `EBML Schema` for that version of the `EBML Document Type`. Any data contained within a `Master Element` that is not part of a `Child Element` MUST be ignored.

## Binary Element

A `Binary Element` MUST declare a length in octets from zero to `VINTMAX`.

The contents of a `Binary Element` should not be interpreted by the `EBML Reader`.

# Terminating Elements

`Null Octets`, which are octets with all bits set to zero, MAY follow the value of a `String Element` or `UTF-8 Element` to serve as a terminator. An `EBML Writer` MAY terminate a `String Element` or `UTF-8 Element` with `Null Octets` in order to overwrite a stored value with a new value of lesser length while maintaining the same `Element Data Size` (this can prevent the need to rewrite large portions of an `EBML Document`); otherwise the use of `Null Octets` within a `String Element` or `UTF-8 Element` is NOT RECOMMENDED. An `EBML Reader` MUST consider the value of the `String Element` or `UTF-8 Element` to be terminated upon the first read `Null Octet` and MUST ignore any data following the first `Null Octet` within that `Element`. A string value and a copy of that string value terminated by one or more `Null Octets` are semantically equal.

The following table shows examples of semantics and validation for the use of `Null Octets`. Values to represent `Stored Values` and the `Semantic Meaning` as represented as hexadecimal values.

Stored Value        | Semantic Meaning
:-------------------|:-------------------
0x65 0x62 0x6d 0x6c | 0x65 0x62 0x6d 0x6c
0x65 0x62 0x00 0x6c | 0x65 0x62
0x65 0x62 0x00 0x00 | 0x65 0x62
0x65 0x62           | 0x65 0x62

# Guidelines for Updating Elements

An EBML Document can be updated without requiring that the entire EBML Document be rewritten. These recommendations describe strategies to change the `Element Data` of a written `EBML Element` with minimal disruption to the rest of the `EBML Document`.

## Reducing a Element Data in Size

There are three methods to reduce the size of `Element Data` of a written `EBML Element`.

### Adding a Void Element

When an `EBML Element` is changed to reduce its total length by more than one octet, an `EBML Writer` SHOULD fill the freed space with a `Void Element`.

### Extending the Element Data Size

The same value for `Element Data Size` MAY be written in variable lengths, so for minor reductions in octet length the `Element Data Size` MAY be written to a longer octet length to fill the freed space.

For example, the first row of the following table depicts a `String Element` that stores an `Element ID` (3 octets), `Element Data Size` (1 octet), and `Element Data` (4 octets). If the `Element Data` is changed to reduce the length by one octet and if the current length of the `Element Data Size` is less than its maximum permitted length, then the `Element Data Size` of that `Element` MAY be rewritten to increase its length by one octet. Thus before and after the change the `EBML Element` maintains the same length of 8 octets and data around the `Element` does not need to be moved.

| Status      | Element ID | Element Data Size | Element Data       |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Before edit | 0x3B4040   | 0x84              | 0x65626d6c         |
| After edit  | 0x3B4040   | 0x4003            | 0x6d6b76           |

This method is only RECOMMENDED for reducing `Element Data` by a single octet; for reductions by two or more octets it is RECOMMENDED to fill the freed space with a `Void Element`.

Note that if the `Element Data` length needs to be rewritten as shortened by one octet and the `Element Data Size` could be rewritten as a shorter `VINT` then it is RECOMMENDED to rewrite the `Element Data Size` as one octet shorter, shorten the `Element Data` by one octet, and follow that `Element` with a `Void Element`. For example, the following table depicts a `String Element` that stores an `Element ID` (3 octets), `Element Data Size` (2 octets, but could be rewritten in one octet), and `Element Data` (3 octets). If the `Element Data` is to be rewritten to a two octet length, then another octet can be taken from `Element Data Size` so that there is enough space to add a two octet `Void Element`.

Status | Element ID | Element Data Size | Element Data | Void Element
-------|------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------
Before | 0x3B4040   | 0x4003            | 0x6d6b76     |
After  | 0x3B4040   | 0x82              | 0x6869       | 0xEC80

### Terminating Element Data

For `String Elements` and `UTF-8 Elements` the length of `Element Data` MAY be reduced by adding `Null Octets` to terminate the `Element Data` (see [the section on `Terminating Elements`](#terminating-elements)).

In the following table, a four octet long `Element Data` is changed to a three octet long value followed by a `Null Octet`; the `Element Data Size` includes any `Null Octets` used to terminate `Element Data` so remains unchanged.

| Status      | Element ID | Element Data Size | Element Data       |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Before edit | 0x3B4040   | 0x84              | 0x65626d6c         |
| After edit  | 0x3B4040   | 0x84              | 0x6d6b7600         |

Note that this method is NOT RECOMMENDED. For reductions of one octet, the method for `Extending the Element Data Size` SHOULD be used. For reduction by more than one octet, the method for `Adding a Void Element` SHOULD be used.

## Considerations when Updating Elements with CRC

If the `Element` to be changed is a `Descendant Element` of any `Master Element` that contains an `CRC-32 Element` then the `CRC-32 Element` MUST be verified before permitting the change. Additionally the `CRC-32 Element` value MUST be subsequently updated to reflect the changed data.

# EBML Document

An `EBML Document` is comprised of only two components, an `EBML Header` and an `EBML Body`. An `EBML Document` MUST start with an `EBML Header` that declares significant characteristics of the entire `EBML Body`. An `EBML Document` consists of `EBML Elements` and MUST NOT contain any data that is not part of an `EBML Element`.

## EBML Header

The `EBML Header` is a declaration that provides processing instructions and identification of the `EBML Body`. The `EBML Header` of an `EBML Document` is analogous to the XML Declaration of an XML Document.

The `EBML Header` documents the `EBML Schema` (also known as the `EBML DocType`) that is used to semantically interpret the structure and meaning of the `EBML Document`. Additionally the `EBML Header` documents the versions of both `EBML` and the `EBML Schema` that were used to write the `EBML Document` and the versions required to read the `EBML Document`.

The `EBML Header` MUST contain a single `Master Element` with an `Element Name` of `EBML` and `Element ID` of `0x1A45DFA3` (see [the definition of the `EBML` Element](#ebml-element)) and any number of additional `EBML Elements` within it. The `EBML Header` MUST only contain `EBML Elements` that are defined as part of this document.

All `EBML Elements` within the `EBML Header` MUST NOT use any `Element ID` with a length greater than 4 octets. All `EBML Elements` within the `EBML Header` MUST NOT use any `Element Data Size` with a length greater than 4 octets.

## EBML Body

All data of an `EBML Document` following the `EBML Header` is the `EBML Body`. The end of the `EBML Body`, as well as the end of the `EBML Document` that contains the `EBML Body`, is considered as whichever comes first: the beginning of a new `EBML Header` at the `Root Level` or the end of the file. The `EBML Body` MUST consist only of `EBML Elements` and MUST NOT contain any data that is not part of an `EBML Element`. This document defines precisely what `EBML Elements` are to be used within the `EBML Header`, but does not name or define what `EBML Elements` are to be used within the `EBML Body`. The definition of what `EBML Elements` are to be used within the `EBML Body` is defined by an `EBML Schema`.

# EBML Stream

An `EBML Stream` is a file that consists of one or many `EBML Documents` that are concatenated together. An occurrence of a `EBML Header` at the `Root Level` marks the beginning of an `EBML Document`.

# Elements semantic

## EBML Schema

An `EBML Schema` is an XML Document that defines the properties, arrangement, and usage of `EBML Elements` that compose a specific `EBML Document Type`. The relationship of an `EBML Schema` to an `EBML Document` may be considered analogous to the relationship of an XML Schema [@?W3C.REC-xmlschema-0-20010502] to an XML Document [@!W3C.REC-xml-20081126]. An `EBML Schema` MUST be clearly associated with one or many `EBML Document Types`. An `EBML Schema` must be expressed as well-formed XML. An `EBML Document Type` is identified by a string stored within the `EBML Header` in the `DocType Element`; for example `matroska` or `webm` (see [the definition of the `DocType Element`](#doctype-element)). The `DocType` value for an `EBML Document Type` SHOULD be unique and persistent.

An `EBML Schema` MUST declare exactly one `EBML Element` at `Root Level` (referred to as the `Root Element`) that MUST occur exactly once within an `EBML Document`. The `Void Element` MAY also occur at `Root Level` but is not considered to be `Root Elements` (see [the definition of the `Void Element`](#void-element)).

The `EBML Schema` MUST document all Elements of the `EBML Body`. The `EBML Schema` does not document `Global Elements` that are defined by this document (namely the `Void Element` and the `CRC-32 Element`).

An `EBML Schema` MAY constrain the use of `EBML Header Elements` (see [EBML Header Elements](#ebml-header-elements)) by adding or constraining that Element's `range` attribute. For example, an `EBML Schema` MAY constrain the `EBMLMaxSizeLength` to a maximum value of `8` or MAY constain the `EBMLVersion` to only support a value of `1`. If an `EBML Schema` adopts the `EBML Header Element` as-is, then it is not REQUIRED to document that Element within the `EBML Schema`. If an `EBML Schema` constrains the range of an `EBML Header Element`, then that `Element` MUST be documented within an `<element>` node of the `EBML Schema`. This document provides an example of an `EBML Schema`, see [EBML Schema Example](#ebml-schema-example).

### <EBMLSchema> Element

As an XML Document, the `EBML Schema` MUST use `<EBMLSchema>` as the top level element. The `<EBMLSchema>` element MAY contain `<element>` sub-elements.

### <EBMLSchema> Attributes

Within an `EBML Schema` the `<EBMLSchema>` element uses the following attributes:

#### docType

The `docType` lists the official name of the `EBML Document Type` that is defined by the `EBML Schema`; for example, `<EBMLSchema docType="matroska">`.

The `docType` attribute is REQUIRED within the `<EBMLSchema>` Element.

#### version

The `version` lists an incremental non-negative integer that specifies the version of the docType documented by the `EBML Schema`. Unlike XML Schemas, an `EBML Schema` documents all versions of a docType's definition rather than using separate `EBML Schemas` for each version of a `docType`. `EBML Elements` may be introduced and deprecated by using the `minver` and `maxver` attributes of `<element>`.

The `version` attribute is REQUIRED within the `<EBMLSchema>` Element.

### <element> Element

Each `<element>` defines one `EBML Element` through the use of several attributes that are defined in [EBML Schema Element Attributes](#ebmlschema-attributes). `EBML Schemas` MAY contain additional attributes to extend the semantics but MUST NOT conflict with the definitions of the `<element>` attributes defined within this document.

The `<element>` nodes contain a description of the meaning and use of the `EBML Element` stored within one or many `<documentation>` sub-elements and zero or one `<restriction>` sub-element. All `<element>` nodes MUST be sub-elements of the `<EBMLSchema>`.

### <element> Attributes

Within an `EBML Schema` the `<element>` uses the following attributes to define an `EBML Element`:

#### name

The `name` provides the official human-readable name of the `EBML Element`. The value of the name MUST be in the form of characters "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", "-" and ".".

The `name` attribute is REQUIRED.

#### path

The path defines the allowed storage locations of the `EBML Element` within an `EBML Document`. This path MUST be defined with the full hierarchy of `EBML Elements` separated with a `/`. The top `EBML Element` in the path hierarchy being the first in the value. The syntax of the `path` attribute is defined using this Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [@!RFC5234] with the case sensitive update [@!RFC7405] notation:

The `path` attribute is REQUIRED.

```
EBMLFullPath           = EBMLElementOccurrence "(" EBMLReferencePath ")"
EBMLReferencePath        = [EBMLParentPath] EBMLElementPath
EBMLParentPath           = EBMLFixedParent EBMLLastParent
EBMLFixedParent          = *(EBMLPathAtom)
EBMLElementPath          = EBMLPathAtom / EBMLPathAtomRecursive
EBMLPathAtom             = PathDelimiter EBMLAtomName
EBMLPathAtomRecursive    = "(1*(" EBMLPathAtom "))"
EBMLLastParent           = EBMLPathAtom / EBMLVariableParent
EBMLVariableParent       = "(" VariableParentOccurrence "\)"
EBMLAtomName             = 1*(EBMLNameChar)
EBMLNameChar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "."
PathDelimiter            = "\"
EBMLElementOccurrence    = [EBMLMinOccurrence] "*" [EBMLMaxOccurrence]
EBMLMinOccurrence        = 1*DIGIT
EBMLMaxOccurrence        = 1*DIGIT
VariableParentOccurrence = [PathMinOccurrence] "*" [PathMaxOccurrence]
PathMinOccurrence        = 1*DIGIT
PathMaxOccurrence        = 1*DIGIT
```

The `"*"`, `"("` and `")"` symbols MUST be interpreted as they are defined in the ABNF.

The `EBMLPathAtom` part of the `EBMLElementPath` MUST be equal to the `name` attribute of the `EBML Schema`.

The starting `PathDelimiter` of the path corresponds to the root of the `EBML Document`.

The `EBMLElementOccurrence` part is interpreted as an ABNF Variable Repetition. The repetition amounts correspond to how many times the `EBML Element` can be found in its `Parent Element`.

The `EBMLMinOccurrence` represents the minimum number of occurrences of this `EBML Element` within its `Parent Element`. Each instance of the `Parent Element` MUST contain at least this many instances of this `EBML Element`. If the `EBML Element` has an empty `EBMLParentPath` then `EBMLMinOccurrence` refers to constraints on the occurrence of the `EBML Element` within the `EBML Document`. If `EBMLMinOccurrence` is not present then that `EBML Element` is considered to have a `EBMLMinOccurrence` value of 0. The semantic meaning of `EBMLMinOccurrence` within an `EBML Schema` is considered analogous to the meaning of `minOccurs` within an `XML Schema`. `EBML Elements` with `EBMLMinOccurrence` set to "1" that also have a `default` value (see [default](#default)) declared are not REQUIRED to be stored but are REQUIRED to be interpreted, see [Note on the Use of default attributes to define Mandatory EBML Elements](#note-on-the-use-of-default-attributes-to-define-mandatory-ebml-elements). An `EBML Element` defined with a `EBMLMinOccurrence` value greater than zero is called a `Mandatory EBML Element`.

The `EBMLMaxOccurrence` represents the maximum number of occurrences of this `EBML Element` within its `Parent Element`. Each instance of the `Parent Element` MUST contain at most this many instances of this `EBML Element`. If the `EBML Element` has an empty `EBMLParentPath` then `EBMLMaxOccurrence` refers to constraints on the occurrence of the `EBML Element` within the `EBML Document`. If `EBMLMaxOccurrence` is not present then that `EBML Element` is considered to have no maximum occurrence. The semantic meaning of `EBMLMaxOccurrence` within an `EBML Schema path` is considered analogous to the meaning of `maxOccurs` within an `XML Schema`.

The `VariableParentOccurrence` part is interpreted as an ABNF Variable Repetition. The repetition amounts correspond to the amount of unspecified `Parent Element` levels there can be between the `EBMLFixedParent` and the actual `EBMLElementPath`.

If the path contains an `EBMLPathAtomRecursive` part, the `EBML Element` can occur within itself recursively (see the [recursive attribute](#recursive)).

#### id

The `Element ID` encoded as a `Variable Size Integer` expressed in hexadecimal notation prefixed by a `0x` that is read and stored in big-endian order. To reduce the risk of false positives while parsing `EBML Streams`, the `Element IDs` of the `Root Element` and `Top-Level Elements` SHOULD be at least 4 octets in length. `Element IDs` defined for use at `Root Level` or directly under the `Root Level` MAY use shorter octet lengths to facilitate padding and optimize edits to `EBML Documents`; for instance, the `Void Element` uses an `Element ID` with a one octet length to allow its usage in more writing and editing scenarios.

The `id` attribute is REQUIRED.

#### minOccurs

An integer expressing the minimum number of occurrences of this `EBML Element` within its `Parent Element`. The `minOccurs` value MUST be equal to the `EBMLMinOccurrence` value of the `path`.

The `minOccurs` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `minOccurs` attribute is not present then that `EBML Element` is considered to have a `minOccurs` value of 0.

#### maxOccurs

An integer expressing the maximum number of occurrences of this `EBML Element` within its `Parent Element`. The `maxOccurs` value MUST be equal to the `EBMLMaxOccurrence` value of the `path`.

The `maxOccurs` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `maxOccurs` attribute is not present then that `EBML Element` is considered to have no maximum occurrence, similar to `unbounded` in the XML world.

#### range

A numerical range for `EBML Elements` which are of numerical types (Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Float, and Date). If specified the value of the `EBML Element` MUST be within the defined range. See [section of Expressions of range](#expression-of-range) for rules applied to expression of range values.

The `range` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `range` attribute is not present then any value legal for the `type` attribute is valid.

#### size

A value to express the valid length of the `Element Data` as written measured in octets. The `size` provides a constraint in addition to the Length value of the definition of the corresponding `EBML Element Type`. This `size` MUST be expressed as either a non-negative integer or a range (see [expression of range](#expression-of-range)) that consists of only non-negative integers and valid operators.

The `size` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `size` attribute is not present for that `EBML Element` then that `EBML Element` is only limited in size by the definition of the associated `EBML Element Type`.

#### default

If an `Element` is mandatory (has a `EBMLMinOccurrence` value greater than zero) but not written within its `Parent Element` or stored as an `Empty Element`, then the `EBML Reader` of the `EBML Document` MUST semantically interpret the `EBML Element` as present with this specified default value for the `EBML Element`. `EBML Elements` that are `Master Elements` MUST NOT declare a `default` value. `EBML Elements` with a `minOccurs` value greater than 1 MUST NOT declare a `default` value.

The `default` attribute is OPTIONAL.

#### type

The `type` MUST be set to one of the following values: 'integer' (signed integer), 'uinteger' (unsigned integer), 'float', 'string', 'date', 'utf-8', 'master', or 'binary'. The content of each `type` is defined within [section on EBML Element Types](#ebml-element-types).

The `type` attribute is REQUIRED.

#### unknownsizeallowed

A boolean to express if an `EBML Element` MAY be used as an `Unknown-Sized Element` (having all `VINT_DATA` bits of `Element Data Size` set to 1). `EBML Elements` that are not `Master Elements` MUST NOT set `unknownsizeallowed` to true. An `EBML Element` that is defined with an `unknownsizeallowed` attribute set to 1 MUST also have the `unknownsizeallowed` attribute of its `Parent Element` set to 1.

The `unknownsizeallowed` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `unknownsizeallowed` attribute is not used then that `EBML Element` is not allowed to use an unknown `Element Data Size`.

#### recursive

A boolean to express if an `EBML Element` MAY be stored recursively. In this case the `EBML Element` MAY be stored within another `EBML Element` that has the same `Element ID`. Which itself can be stored in an `EBML Element` that has the same `Element ID`, and so on. `EBML Elements` that are not `Master Elements` MUST NOT set `recursive` to true.

If the `path` contains an `EBMLPathAtomRecursive` part then the `recursive` value MUST be true and false otherwise.

The `recursive` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `recursive` attribute is not present then the `EBML Element` MUST NOT be used recursively.

#### minver

The `minver` (minimum version) attribute stores a non-negative integer that represents the first version of the `docType` to support the `EBML Element`.

The `minver` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `minver` attribute is not present, then the `EBML Element` has a minimum version of "1".

#### maxver

The `maxver` (maximum version) attribute stores a non-negative integer that represents the last or most recent version of the `docType` to support the element. `maxver` MUST be greater than or equal to `minver`.

The `maxver` attribute is OPTIONAL. If the `maxver` attribute is not present then the `EBML Element` has a maximum version equal to the value stored in the `version` attribute of `<EBMLSchema>`.

### <documentation> Element

The `<documentation>` element provides additional information about the `EBML Element`.

### <documentation> Attributes

#### lang

A `lang` attribute which is set to the [@!RFC5646] value of the language of the element's documentation.

The `lang` attribute is OPTIONAL.

#### type

A `type` attribute distinguishes the meaning of the documentation. Values for the `<documentation>` sub-element's `type` attribute MUST include one of the following: `definition`, `rationale`, `usage notes`, and `references`.

The `type` attribute is OPTIONAL.

### <restriction> Element

The `<restriction>` element provides information about restrictions to the allowable values for the `EBML Element` which are listed in `<enum>` elements.

### <enum> Element

The `<enum>` element stores a list of values allowed for storage in the `EBML Element`. The values MUST match the `type` of the `EBML Element` (for example `<enum value="Yes">` cannot be a valid value for a `EBML Element` that is defined as an unsigned integer). An `<enum>` element MAY also store `<documentation>` elements to further describe the `<enum>`.

### <enum> Attributes

#### label

The `label` provides a concise expression for human consumption that describes what the `value` of the `<enum>` represents.

The `label` attribute is OPTIONAL.

#### value

The `value` represents data that MAY be stored within the `EBML Element`.

The `value` attribute is REQUIRED.

### XML Schema for EBML Schema

<{{EBMLSchema.xsd}}

### EBML Schema Example

<{{ebml_schema_example.xml}}

### Identically Recurring Elements

An `Identically Recurring Element` is an `EBML Element` that MAY occur within its `Parent Element` more than once but that each recurrence within that `Parent Element` MUST be identical both in storage and semantics. `Identically Recurring Elements` are permitted to be stored multiple times within the same `Parent Element` in order to increase data resilience and optimize the use of `EBML` in transmission. For instance a pertinent `Top-Level Element` could be periodically resent within a data stream so that an `EBML Reader` which starts reading the stream from the middle could better interpret the contents. `Identically Recurring Elements` SHOULD include a `CRC-32 Element` as a `Child Element`; this is especially recommended when `EBML` is used for long-term storage or transmission. If a `Parent Element` contains more than one copy of an `Identically Recurring Element` which includes a `CRC-32 Element` as a `Child Element` then the first instance of the `Identically Recurring Element` with a valid CRC-32 value should be used for interpretation. If a `Parent Element` contains more than one copy of an `Identically Recurring Element` which does not contain a `CRC-32 Element` or if `CRC-32 Elements` are present but none are valid then the first instance of the `Identically Recurring Element` should be used for interpretation.

### Expression of range

The `range` attribute MUST only be used with `EBML Elements` that are either `signed integer`, `unsigned integer`, `float`, or `date`. The `range` expression may contain whitespace for readability but whitespace within a `range` expression MUST NOT convey meaning. The expression of the `range` MUST adhere to one of the following forms:

- `x-y` where x and y are integers or floats and `y` MUST be greater than `x`, meaning that the value MUST be greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `y`. `x` MUST be less than `y`.
- `>x` where `x` is an integer or float, meaning that the value MUST be greater than `x`.
- `>=x` where `x` is an integer or float, meaning that the value MUST be greater than or equal to `x`.
- `<x` where `x` is an integer or float, meaning that the value MUST be less than `x`.
- `<=x` where `x` is an integer or float, meaning that the value MUST be less than or equal to `x`.
- `x` where `x` is an integer or float, meaning that the value MUST be equal `x`.

The `range` may use the prefix `not ` to indicate that the expressed range is negated. Please also see [textual expression of floats](#textual-expression-of-floats).

### Textual expression of floats

When a float value is represented textually in an `EBML Schema`, such as within a `default` or `range` value, the float values MUST be expressed as Hexadecimal Floating-Point Constants as defined in the C11 standard [@!ISO.9899.2011] (see section 6.4.4.2 on Floating Constants). The following table provides examples of expressions of float ranges.

| as decimal        | as Hexadecimal Floating-Point Constants |
|:------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| 0.0-1.0           | `0x0p+1-0x1p+0`                         |
| 1.0-256.0         | `0x1p+0-0x1p+8`                         |
| 0.857421875       | `0x1.b7p-1`                             |
| -1.0--0.857421875 | `-0x1p+0--0x1.b7p-1`                    |

Within an expression of a float range, as in an integer range, the `-` (hyphen) character is the separator between the minimal and maximum value permitted by the range. Hexadecimal Floating-Point Constants also use a `-` (hyphen) when indicating a negative binary power. Within a float range, when a `-` (hyphen) is immediately preceded by a letter `p`, then the `-` (hyphen) is a part of the Hexadecimal Floating-Point Constant which notes negative binary power. Within a float range, when a `-` (hyphen) is not immediately preceded by a letter `p`, then the `-` (hyphen) represents the separator between the minimal and maximum value permitted by the range.

### Note on the use of default attributes to define Mandatory EBML Elements

If a `Mandatory EBML Element` has a default value declared by an `EBML Schema` and the value of the `EBML Element` is equal to the declared default value then that `EBML Element` is not required to be present within the `EBML Document` if its `Parent Element` is present. In this case, the default value of the `Mandatory EBML Element` MUST be interpreted by the `EBML Reader` although the `EBML Element` is not present within its `Parent Element`.

If a `Mandatory EBML Element` has no default value declared by an `EBML Schema` and its `Parent Element` is present then the `EBML Element` MUST be present as well. If a `Mandatory EBML Element` has a default value declared by an `EBML Schema` and its `Parent Element` is present and the value of the `EBML Element` is NOT equal to the declared default value then the `EBML Element` MUST be present.

This table clarifies if a `Mandatory EBML Element` MUST be written, according to if the `default` value is declared, if the value of the `EBML Element` is equal to the declared `default` value, and if the `Parent Element` is used.

| Is the default value declared? | Is the value equal to default? | Is the Parent Element present? | Then is storing the EBML Element REQUIRED? |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
| Yes               | Yes                     | Yes                  | No                                         |
| Yes               | Yes                     | No                   | No                                         |
| Yes               | No                      | Yes                  | Yes                                        |
| Yes               | No                      | No                   | No                                         |
| No                | n/a                     | Yes                  | Yes                                        |
| No                | n/a                     | No                   | No                                         |

default: 1

type: Unsigned Integer

description: The minimum `EBML` version an `EBML Reader` has to support to read this `EBML Document`. The `EBMLReadVersion Element` MUST be less than or equal to `EBMLVersion`.

### EBMLMaxIDLength Element

name: `EBMLMaxIDLength`

path: `1*1(\EBML\EBMLMaxIDLength)`

id `0x42F2`

minOccurs: 1

maxOccurs: 1

range:  >=4

default: 4

type: Unsigned Integer

description: The `EBMLMaxIDLength Element` stores the maximum length in octets of the `Element IDs` to be found within the `EBML Body`. An `EBMLMaxIDLength Element` value of four is RECOMMENDED, though larger values are allowed.

### EBMLMaxSizeLength Element

name: `EBMLMaxSizeLength`

path: `1*1(\EBML\EBMLMaxSizeLength)`

id `0x42F3`

minOccurs: 1

maxOccurs: 1

range:  not 0

default: 8

type: Unsigned Integer

description: The `EBMLMaxSizeLength Element` stores the maximum length in octets of the expression of all `Element Data Sizes` to be found within the `EBML Body`. To be clear the `EBMLMaxSizeLength Element` documents the maximum 'length' of all `Element Data Size` expressions within the `EBML Body` and not the maximum 'value' of all `Element Data Size` expressions within the `EBML Body`. `EBML Elements` that have an `Element Data Size` expression which is larger in octets than what is expressed by `EBMLMaxSizeLength ELEMENT` SHALL be considered invalid.

### DocType Element

name: `DocType`

path: `1*1(\EBML\DocType)`

id `0x4282`

minOccurs: 1

maxOccurs: 1

size: >0

type: String

description: A string that describes and identifies the content of the `EBML Body` that follows this `EBML Header`.

### DocTypeVersion Element

name: `DocTypeVersion`

path: `1*1(\EBML\DocTypeVersion)`

id `0x4287`

minOccurs: 1

maxOccurs: 1

default: 1

type: Unsigned Integer

description: The version of `DocType` interpreter used to create the `EBML Document`.

### DocTypeReadVersion Element

name: DocTypeReadVersion

path: `1*1(\EBML\DocTypeReadVersion)`

id `0x4285`

minOccurs: 1

maxOccurs: 1

default: 1

type: Unsigned Integer

description: The minimum `DocType` version an `EBML Reader` has to support to read this `EBML Document`. The value of the `DocTypeReadVersion Element` MUST be less than or equal to the value of the `DocTypeVersion Element`.

## EBML Global Elements

EBML defines these `Global Elements` which MAY be stored within any `Master Element` of an `EBML Document` as defined by their `Element Path`.

### CRC-32 Element

name: CRC-32

path: `*1((1*\)\CRC-32)`

id: `0xBF`

minOccurs: 0

maxOccurs: 1

size: 4

type: Binary

description: The `CRC-32 Element` contains a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check value of all the `Element Data` of the `Parent Element` as stored except for the `CRC-32 Element` itself. When the `CRC-32 Element` is present, the `CRC-32 Element` MUST be the first ordered `EBML Element` within its `Parent Element` for easier reading. All `Top-Level Elements` of an `EBML Document` that are `Master Elements` SHOULD include a `CRC-32 Element` as a `Child Element`. The CRC in use is the IEEE-CRC-32 algorithm as used in the [@!ISO.3309.1979] standard and in section 8.1.1.6.2 of [@!ITU.V42.1994], with initial value of `0xFFFFFFFF`. The CRC value MUST be computed on a little endian bitstream and MUST use little endian storage.

### Void Element

name: Void

path: `*((*\)\Void)`

id: `0xEC`

minOccurs: 0

type: Binary

description: Used to void damaged data, to avoid unexpected behaviors when using damaged data. The content is discarded. Also used to reserve space in a sub-element for later use.
